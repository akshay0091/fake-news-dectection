era of Roger Ailes at Fox News is definitely over after this devastating blow.Earlier this month, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson revealed that she was no longer with the conservative network. As it turns out, she had been fired by Roger Ailes because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him.Her lawsuit alleges that Ailes relentlessly ogled her and treated her like a sexual object in the workplace. She faced constant sexual harassment from Ailes and her male colleagues and when she tried to get the harassment to stop Ailes told her it would all go away if she would just agree to let him have sex with her. She declined, so Ailes fired her from Fox & Friends and moved her to an unpopular time slot with a pay reduction and more work in order to force her to submit to his demand. After she continued to refuse, Ailes fired her from the network entirely. I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career,  Carlson said in a statement.  Although this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace. But other women on Fox News were not as brave as Carlson. They sided with Ailes and threw Carlson under the bus.But the most powerful woman on Fox News is no longer remaining quiet and that is bad news for Ailes.New York Magazine reports that Megyn Kelly has met with attorneys representing the Murdochs, who own Fox, and told them how Roger Ailes sexually harassed her when she was a correspondent for the network.According to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail.As New York Magazine notes, this is probably the reason why Kelly had remained silent in the wake of the scandal, waiting for the right time to strike. And if the sources are accurate, Kelly just delivered the death blow to Ailes  career with Fox.Ailes has reportedly been given an August 1st deadline to resign or he will be fired for just cause.And Murdoch s attorneys are not done investigating yet so there could be even more revelations to come.Meanwhile, the Paul, Weiss lawyers are attempting to interview former Fox employees who have stories of harassment but haven t spoken because they signed settlements with Ailes s Fox attorney, Dianne Brandi. 21st Century Fox is now waiving the NDAs to allow women to speak.If this report is correct it could spell the end of Roger Ailes at Fox News and that would be a good thing for everyone. Now let s wait and see how many of Ailes  female defenders start attacking Megyn Kelly.Featured image via Wikimedia'"]},"execution_count":19,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["X[3]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"id":"9b3d9ad3","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.513793Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.513348Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.522354Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.521173Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.026786,"end_time":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.524838","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.498052","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["0        0\n","1        1\n","2        0\n","3        1\n","4        0\n","        ..\n","44893    1\n","44894    0\n","44895    1\n","44896    1\n","44897    1\n","Name: class, Length: 44898, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":20,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["y"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"id":"14b42585","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.555475Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.554537Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-15T09:12:20.745856Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-15T09:12:20.744174Z"},"papermill":{"duration":13.210658,"end_time":"2022-09-15T09:12:20.749699","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-09-15T09:12:07.539041","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: nltk in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (3.7)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from nltk) (4.64.0)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: click in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from nltk) (8.0.4)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: joblib in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from nltk) (1.0.1)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: regex>=2021.8.3 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from nltk) (2021.11.10)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from click->nltk) (4.12.0)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.6.4 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from importlib-metadata->click->nltk) (4.1.1)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: zipp>=0.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from importlib-metadata->click->nltk) (3.8.0)\r\n","\u001b[33mWARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

Democratic congressional leaders on immigration policy, government spending and other issues that need to be wrapped up early in the new year. The expected flurry of legislative activity comes as Republicans and Democrats begin to set the stage for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s Republican Party is eager to maintain control of Congress while Democrats look for openings to wrest seats away in the Senate and the House of Representatives. On Wednesday, Trump’s budget chief Mick Mulvaney and legislative affairs director Marc Short will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan - both Republicans - and their Democratic counterparts, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the White House said. That will be followed up with a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump, McConnell and Ryan on Jan. 6 and 7 at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, according to the White House. The Senate returns to work on Jan. 3 and the House on Jan. 8. Congress passed a short-term government funding bill last week before taking its Christmas break, but needs to come to an agreement on defense spending and various domestic programs by Jan. 19, or the government will shut down. Also on the agenda for lawmakers is disaster aid for people hit by hurricanes in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, and by wildfires in California. The House passed an $81 billion package in December, which the Senate did not take up. The White House has asked for a smaller figure, $44 billion. Deadlines also loom for soon-to-expire protections for young adult immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, known as “Dreamers.” In September, Trump ended Democratic former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected Dreamers from deportation and provided work permits, effective in March, giving Congress until then to devise a long-term solution. Democrats, some Republicans and a number of large companies have pushed for DACA protections to continue. Trump and other Republicans have said that will not happen without Congress approving broader immigration policy changes and tougher border security. Democrats oppose funding for a wall promised by Trump along the U.S.-Mexican border.  “The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc,” Trump said in a Twitter post on Friday. Trump wants to overhaul immigration rules for extended families and others seeking to live in the United States. Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of the president, said he would work with Trump to protect Dreamers. “We can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security, stops chain migration for the DREAMers, and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery. If POTUS (Trump) wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that promise,” Flake wrote on Twitter. Congress in early 2018 also must raise the U.S. debt ceiling to avoid a government default. The U.S. Treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump, who won his first major legislative victory with the passage of a major tax overhaul this month, has also promised a major infrastructure plan.'\n","manual_testing(news)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"id":"b3c9c52a","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-15T09:17:09.697912Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-15T09:17:09.697225Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-15T09:17:09.703427Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-15T09:17:09.702405Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.024474,"end_time":"2022-09-15T09:17:09.705621","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-09-15T09:17:09.681147","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'The era of Roger Ailes at Fox News is definitely over after this devastating blow.Earlier this month, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson revealed that she was no longer with the conservative network.

She faced constant sexual harassment from Ailes and her male colleagues and when she tried to get the harassment to stop Ailes told her it would all go away if she would just agree to let him have sex with her. She declined, so Ailes fired her from Fox & Friends and moved her to an unpopular time slot with a pay reduction and more work in order to force her to submit to his demand. After she continued to refuse, Ailes fired her from the network entirely. I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career,  Carlson said in a statement.  Although this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace. But other women on Fox News were not as brave as Carlson. They sided with Ailes and threw Carlson under the bus.But the most powerful woman on Fox News is no longer remaining quiet and that is bad news for Ailes.New York Magazine reports that Megyn Kelly has met with attorneys representing the Murdochs, who own Fox, and told them how Roger Ailes sexually harassed her when she was a correspondent for the network.According to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail.As New York Magazine notes, this is probably the reason why Kelly had remained silent in the wake of the scandal, waiting for the right time to strike. And if the sources are accurate, Kelly just delivered the death blow to Ailes  career with Fox.Ailes has reportedly been given an August 1st deadline to resign or he will be fired for just cause.And Murdoch s attorneys are not done investigating yet so there could be even more revelations to come.Meanwhile, the Paul, Weiss lawyers are attempting to interview former Fox employees who have stories of harassment but haven t spoken because they signed settlements with Ailes s Fox attorney, Dianne Brandi. 21st Century Fox is now waiving the NDAs to allow women to speak.If this report is correct it could spell the end of Roger Ailes at Fox News and that would be a good thing for everyone.
